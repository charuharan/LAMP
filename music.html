<p>This is taken from the link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music#:~:text=Carnatic%20music%2C%20known%20as%20Karn%C4%81%E1%B9%ADaka,Tamil%20Nadu%2C%20and%20Sri%20Lanka" alt="classical music">music</a>
Ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the swaras, or notes, to the sounds of animals and birds and man's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception.<br>
The Sama Veda, which is believed to have laid the foundation for Indian classical music, consists of hymns from the Rigveda, set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during Vedic yajnas.<br>
The Yajur-Veda, which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae, mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations.<br>
References to Indian classical music are made in many ancient texts, including epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.</p>
